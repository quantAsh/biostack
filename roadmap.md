# BiohackStack: Production & Decentralization Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for transitioning BiohackStack from its current state to a production-ready, decentralized application powered by Python, IPFS, and the Solana blockchain.

---

## Phase 1: Hardening for Production (Current Stack)

**Goal:** Ensure the existing application is stable, secure, and scalable before undertaking a major migration.

### ✅ Frontend Checklist
- [ ] **UI/UX Polish:** Conduct a full audit to fix all minor visual inconsistencies, ensuring a pixel-perfect user experience.
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing:** Implement a full suite of tests, including unit tests (Vitest), integration tests, and end-to-end tests (e.g., Playwright, Cypress) covering all user flows.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization:**
    - [ ] Analyze and reduce bundle size.
    - [ ] Implement code-splitting and lazy loading for components and views.
    - [ ] Optimize re-renders with `React.memo` and `useCallback`.
- [ ] **Accessibility (A11y):** Perform a full accessibility audit, ensuring all components are keyboard-navigable and have appropriate ARIA attributes.
- [ ] **Error Reporting:** Integrate a third-party error monitoring service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) to capture and report production errors.
- [ ] **Dependency Audit:** Review and update all frontend dependencies to their latest stable versions, addressing any security vulnerabilities.

### ✅ Backend (Firebase) Checklist
- [ ] **Firestore Security Rules:** Lock down all Firestore rules to be as restrictive as possible, ensuring users can only access and modify their own data.
- [ ] **Cloud Functions Optimization:** Analyze and optimize all Cloud Functions for cold starts and ensure all write operations are idempotent.
- [ ] **Scalability Testing:** Conduct load testing on key Firebase services, particularly Authentication and high-traffic Firestore collections.
- [ ] **Backup & Recovery Plan:** Establish and test a formal backup and disaster recovery plan for all production Firebase data.
- [ ] **Secret Management:** Move all API keys and secrets from environment variables to a secure secret manager (e.g., Google Secret Manager).

### ✅ DevOps Checklist
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a full CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) that automatically runs tests, checks for linting errors, and deploys to staging/production on successful merges.
- [ ] **Environment Separation:** Create distinct and fully separate staging and production environments in Firebase.
- [ ] **Monitoring & Alerting:** Configure Firebase Performance Monitoring and Google Cloud Monitoring to track app performance and set up alerts for critical errors or downtime.

## Phase 2: Backend Migration - Python & IPFS (Off-Chain Layer)

**Goal:** Rebuild the application's core logic on a scalable, self-hosted Python backend and migrate large, user-owned data to IPFS.

### ✅ Architecture & Design
- [ ] **API Schema Definition:** Design the full API schema using a modern framework like FastAPI with Pydantic for data validation.
- [ ] **Database Selection:** Finalize the choice of a primary database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for relational data (user profiles, public stacks, game state).
- [ ] **IPFS Strategy:** Define the strategy for integrating with IPFS, including choosing a pinning service (e.g., Pinata, Infura) and a data encryption standard.

### ✅ Python API Development
- [ ] **Core Services:** Build out core API services for user authentication (e.g., JWT-based), profile management, and CRUD operations for protocols/stacks.
- [ ] **Business Logic:** Re-implement all gamification logic (XP, levels, Mastery Points, synergies, duels) as robust, testable services.
- [ ] **Gemini Integration:** Integrate the Gemini API via the official Python SDK for all AI-powered features.
- [ ] **Admin Endpoints:** Develop a full suite of secure endpoints to power the Admin Command Center.

### ✅ IPFS Integration
- [ ] **Node/Pinning Service Setup:** Configure the chosen IPFS pinning service and integrate it with the Python backend.
- [ ] **Encryption Service:** Create a service to encrypt user data (e.g., journal entries) with a user-controlled key before pinning to IPFS.
- [ ] **Data Management:** Develop the logic to store IPFS Content Identifiers (CIDs) in the primary database and allow users to retrieve and decrypt their own data.

### ✅ Data Migration
- [ ] **Export Scripts:** Write and test scripts to export all data from Firebase Firestore into a standardized format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
- [ ] **Import Scripts:** Write and test scripts to transform and import the exported data into the new PostgreSQL schema and IPFS.
- [ ] **Migration Plan:** Create a detailed plan for a maintenance window to perform the final, definitive data migration.

## Phase 3: Web3 Integration - Solana (On-Chain Layer)

**Goal:** Decentralize the economic and value-based components of the application to create a true, player-owned economy.

### ✅ Smart Contract Development (Anchor Framework)
- [ ] **$BIO Token:** Create and deploy a Solana Program Library (SPL) token for the `$BIO` in-app currency.
- [ ] **Protocol NFTs:** Develop a Solana program for the Genesis Forge to mint, manage, and trade Protocol NFTs, adhering to the Metaplex standard.
- [ ] **Staking Contracts:** Implement Solana programs for both Research Bounty staking and the social "Bio-Staking" feature.
- [ ] **Marketplace Contract:** Develop a program to facilitate the trustless buying and selling of Protocol NFTs between players.

### ✅ Frontend Integration (Solana Web3.js / Wallet-Adapter)
- [ ] **Wallet Integration:** Integrate the Solana Wallet-Adapter to support popular wallets like Phantom and Solflare.
- [ ] **On-Chain Interactions:** Rewrite all relevant frontend functions to interact directly with your new Solana programs for actions like minting, staking, and purchasing.
- [ ] **Marketplace UI:** Build the full user interface for the player-to-player NFT marketplace.
- [ ] **Profile Update:** Update the user profile and wallet views to display on-chain assets, including `$BIO` token balance and owned Protocol NFTs.

### ✅ Backend <> Blockchain Bridge
- [ ] **On-Chain Event Listener:** Develop a service in the Python backend to listen for on-chain events (e.g., an NFT sale) and update the off-chain database accordingly (e.g., updating NFT ownership records).
- [ ] **Secure Wallet Management:** Implement a secure system (e.g., using a hardware security module or a multi-sig wallet) to manage the treasury and program authority wallets.

## Phase 4: Go-Live & Post-Launch Optimization

**Goal:** Execute the final switchover to the new decentralized stack and monitor its performance.

### ✅ Checklist
- [ ] **Final Deployment:** Deploy the full stack (Frontend, Python API, Solana Programs) to production servers.
- [ ] **Execute Migration:** Perform the final data migration during the planned maintenance window.
- [ ] **System Monitoring:** Closely monitor API performance, database load, blockchain transaction costs (gas fees), and overall system health.
- [ ] **User Feedback:** Actively gather user feedback on the new Web3 features and wallet interactions.
- [ ] **Iterate & Optimize:** Begin the ongoing process of optimizing smart contract gas usage, API response times, and frontend performance on the new stack.
