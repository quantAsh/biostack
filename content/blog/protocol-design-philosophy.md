Designing protocols that actually adapt requires merging *mechanistic reasoning* with *empirical correlation loops*.

## Core principles

1. Protocols are hypotheses — they should enumerate assumptions.
2. Adherence friction is a first-class variable (tracked & modeled).
3. Each variable should map to at least one measurable feedback channel.
4. Adjustment cadence must match the biological latency curve of the target system.
5. Privacy boundaries are explicit; user agency overrides automation.

## Adaptation loop

```
Intake → Baseline Modeling → Protocol Activation → Micro Feedback → Adjustment → Outcome Attribution → Retain or Refactor
```

## Anti-patterns we avoid

- Overfitting to short-term noise
- Rewarding streaks over meaningful adaptation
- Hiding export / delete behind dark UX

## What’s next

A public spec of the protocol graph format and a lightweight SDK for community extensions.
