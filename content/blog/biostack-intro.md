Biostack is an adaptive performance OS that fuses protocol design, AI coaching, and biometric feedback into one evolving graph.

## Why now?

Consumer wearables, lab testing, and continuous sensing created a *data exhaust* that is still largely unused. Fragmented apps trap insights in silos and force manual interpretation.

## What we built

- A structured protocol model (stackable, forkable, versioned)
- A correlation + insight engine linking inputs to biomarkers and outcomes
- Contextual AI coaching that suggests micro-adjustments, not motivational spam
- A data sovereignty layer: export, revoke, or anonymize at any time

## Road ahead

We are rolling out progressive cohorts with focused goals: metabolic optimization, cognitive throughput, and deep recovery. Early cohorts help us stressâ€‘test adaptive tuning loops.

Join the waitlist to help shape the platform.
